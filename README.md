# berserkore-windows

A green soldier in his quest to venture to the right side of the screen while killing red soldiers.
This is a reincarnation of a small game I did once when I was much younger.

I started this project on a Linux machine and the code developed well. As of recent months I did not have an access
to a Linux machine and sadly I do my development on Windows. Getting sick of compiling using true build tools like CMake
or SCons (which I originally used), I decided that if I'm targeting Windows at the moment, and I am on Windows, and I
don't want to be an open-source-hippie, I should use Visual Studio (especially since it has a community edition now).

And so I ditched the real programmers' build tools, and for some reason did not create a branch on the old real-men's git
repository for the Windows port.

I believe it should be really easy to compile this one on Linux, or even on a MAC, since I don't use any esoteric platform-specific
stuff. I use SFML, YAML, and Boost. These are certainly an overkill for this kind of project, but I was young and reckless
when this project began. But it's a nice learning experience.

I can't think of anything else to write now. So goodbye.

**Note from 2016** - The Berserkore executable seems to be working under Linux with Wine without much (or any) effort. Also, uf not removed for some reason, a **Windows build should be here: http://eize.ninja/d/berserkore-windows.7z**.
