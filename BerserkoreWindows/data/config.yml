tutorial:
  - |
    "Hello. I am tutorial text. Toggle me with 'h'.
    Use the arrow keys to move, spacebar to shoot.
    Enter will throw a grenade (which reduces points!)
    You can control volume with +/- or toggle mute with S or M."
  - |
    "The enemies are red. Kill them. As you progess more enemies
    will appear and bombs will fall on your head."
  - |
    "If you get hurt, well, you suck. But you can always wait
    somewhere safe and recover slowly - Just like in Call of Duty!
    (...or was it Battlefield? or both???)"
  - |
    "So, your main goal is to gain as much points as you can.
    Note though, that your score is not recorded anywhere."
  - |
    "Tip: Start shooting at the right edge of the screen, before
    entering the next level. This will probably kill enemies
    that stand in the beginning of the next level. To war!"
  - |
    "Tip: Throwing grenades while moving will throw them farther.
    But I guess you were doing so already."
  - |
    "Tip: Think you are mister commando!"
